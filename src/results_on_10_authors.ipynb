           "but follow thou , from spectator turn \n actor or victim in this wretchedness , \n  and what thou wouldst be taught i then may learn \n from thee . now listen . . . in the april prime \n when all the forest tops began to burn \n  with kindling green , touched by the azure clime \n of the young year , i found myself asleep \n under a mountain which from unknown time \n  had yawned into a cavern high deep , \n and from it came a gentle rivulet \n whose water like clear air in its calm sweep \n  bent the soft grass kept for ever wet \n the stems of the sweet flowers , and filled the grove \n with sound which all who hear must needs forget \n  all pleasure all pain , all hate love , \n which they had known before that hour of rest \n a sleeping mother then would dream not of \n  the only child who died upon her breast \n at eventide , a king would mourn no more \n the crown of which his brow was dispossest \n  when the sun lingered o'er the ocean floor \n to gild his rival 's new prosperity . \n thou wouldst forget thus vainly to deplore \n  ills , which if ills , can find no cure from thee , \n the thought of which no other sleep will quell \n nor other music blot from memory \n  so sweet deep is the oblivious spell . \n whether my life had been before that sleep \n the heaven which i imagine , or a hell \n  like this harsh world in which i wake to weep , \n i know not . i arose for a space \n the scene of woods waters seemed to keep , \n  though it was now broad day , a gentle trace \n of light diviner than the common sun \n sheds on the common earth , but all the place \n  was filled with many sounds woven into one \n oblivious melody , confusing sense \n amid the gliding waves shadows dun \n  and as i looked the bright omnipresence \n of morning through the orient cavern flowed , \n and the sun 's image radiantly intense \n  burned on the waters of the well that glowed \n like gold , and threaded all the forest maze \n with winding paths of emerald fire there stood \n  amid the sun , as he amid the blaze \n of his own glory , on the vibrating \n floor of the fountain , paved with flashing rays , \n  a shape all light , which with one hand did fling \n dew on the earth , as if she were the dawn \n whose invisible rain forever seemed to sing \n  a silver music on the mossy lawn , \n and still before her on the dusky grass \n iris her many coloured scarf had drawn . \n  in her right hand she bore a crystal glass \n mantling with bright nepenthe the fierce splendour \n fell from her as she moved under the mass \n  of the deep cavern , with palms so tender \n their tread broke not the mirror of its billow , \n glided along the river , and did bend her \n  head under the dark boughs , till like a willow \n her fair hair swept the bosom of the stream \n that whispered with delight to be their pillow . \n  as one enamoured is upborne in dream \n o'er lily paven lakes mid silver mist \n to wondrous music , so this shape might seem \n  partly to tread the waves with feet which kist \n the dancing foam , partly to glide along \n the airs that roughened the moist amethyst , \n  or the slant morning beams that fell among \n the trees , or the soft shadows of the trees \n and her feet ever to the ceaseless song \n  of leaves winds waves birds bees \n and falling drops moved in a measure new \n yet sweet , as on the summer evening breeze \n  up from the lake a shape of golden dew \n between two rocks , athwart the rising moon , \n moves up the east , where eagle never flew . \n  and still her feet , no less than the sweet tune \n to which they moved , seemed as they moved , to blot \n the thoughts of him who gazed on them , soon \n  all that was seemed as if it had been not , \n as if the gazer 's mind was strewn beneath \n her feet like embers , she , thought by thought , \n  trampled its fires into the dust of death , \n as day upon the threshold of the east \n treads out the lamps of night , until the breath \n  of darkness reillumines even the least \n of heaven 's living eyes like day she came , \n making the night a dream and ere she ceased \n  to move , as one between desire and shame \n suspended , i said ' if , as it doth seem , \n thou comest from the realm without a name , \n  ' into this valley of perpetual dream , \n shew whence i came , and where i am , and why \n pass not away upon the passing stream . ' \n  ' arise and quench thy thirst , ' was her reply , \n and as a shut lily , stricken by the wand \n of dewy morning 's vital alchemy , \n  i rose and , bending at her sweet command , \n touched with faint lips the cup she raised , \n and suddenly my brain became as sand \n  where the first wave had more than half erased \n the track of deer on desert labrador , \n whilst the fierce wolf from which they fled amazed \n  leaves his stamp visibly upon the shore \n until the second bursts so on my sight \n burst a new vision never seen before . \n  and the fair shape waned in the coming light \n as veil by veil the silent splendour drops \n from lucifer , amid the chrysolite \n  of sunrise ere it strike the mountain tops \n and as the presence of that fairest planet \n although unseen is felt by one who hopes \n  that his day 's path may end as he began it \n in that star 's smile , whose light is like the scent \n of a jonquil when evening breezes fan it , \n  or the soft note in which his dear lament \n the brescian shepherd breathes , or the caress \n that turned his weary slumber to content . \n  so knew i in that light 's severe excess \n the presence of that shape which on the stream \n moved , as i moved along the wilderness , \n  more dimly than a day appearing dream , \n the ghost of a forgotten form of sleep \n a light from heaven whose half extinguished beam \n  through the sick day in which we wake to weep \n glimmers , forever sought , forever lost . \n so did that shape its obscure tenour keep \n  beside my path , as silent as a ghost \n but the new vision , and its cold bright car , \n with savage music , stunning music , crost \n  the forest , and as if from some dread war \n triumphantly returning , the loud million \n fiercely extolled the fortune of her star . \n  a moving arch of victory the vermilion \n and green azure plumes of iris had \n built high over her wind winged pavilion , \n  and underneath aetherial glory clad \n the wilderness , and far before her flew \n the tempest of the splendour which forbade \n shadow to fall from leaf or stone the crew \n seemed in that light like atomies that dance \n within a sunbeam . some upon the new \n  embroidery of flowers that did enhance \n the grassy vesture of the desart , played , \n forgetful of the chariot 's swift advance \n  others stood gazing till within the shade \n of the great mountain its light left them dim . \n others outspeeded it , and others made \n  circles around it like the clouds that swim \n round the high moon in a bright sea of air , \n and more did follow , with exulting hymn , \n  the chariot the captives fettered there , \n but all like bubbles on an eddying flood \n fell into the same track at last were \n  borne onward . i among the multitude \n was swept me sweetest flowers delayed not long , \n me not the shadow nor the solitude , \n  me not the falling stream 's lethean song , \n me , not the phantom of that early form \n which moved upon its motion , but among \n  the thickest billows of the living storm \n i plunged , and bared my bosom to the clime \n of that cold light , whose airs too soon deform . \n  before the chariot had begun to climb \n the opposing steep of that mysterious dell , \n behold a wonder worthy of the rhyme \n  of him whom from the lowest depths of hell \n through every paradise through all glory \n love led serene , who returned to tell \n  in words of hate awe the wondrous story \n how all things are transfigured , except love \n for deaf as is a sea which wrath makes hoary \n  the world can hear not the sweet notes that move \n the sphere whose light is melody to lovers \n a wonder worthy of his rhyme the grove \n  grew dense with shadows to its inmost covers , \n the earth was grey with phantoms , the air \n was peopled with dim forms , as when there hovers \n  a flock of vampire bats before the glare \n of the tropic sun , bring ere evening \n strange night upon some indian isle , thus were \n  phantoms diffused around , some did fling \n shadows of shadows , yet unlike themselves , \n behind them , some like eaglets on the wing \n  were lost in the white blaze , others like elves \n danced in a thousand unimagined shapes \n upon the sunny streams grassy shelves \n  and others sate chattering like restless apes \n on vulgar paws and voluble like fire ."

' \\n  ' arise and quench thy thirst , ' was her reply , \\n and as a shut lily , stricken by the wand \\n of dewy morning 's vital alchemy , \\n  i rose and , bending at her sweet command , \\n touched with faint lips the cup she raised , \\n and suddenly my brain became as sand \\n  where the first wave had more than half erased \\n the track of deer on desert labrador , \\n whilst the fierce wolf from which they fled amazed \\n  leaves his stamp visibly upon the shore \\n until the second bursts so on my sight \\n burst a new vision never seen before . \\n  and the fair shape waned in the coming light \\n as veil by veil the silent splendour drops \\n from lucifer , amid the chrysolite \\n  of sunrise ere it strike the mountain tops \\n and as the presence of that fairest planet \\n although unseen is felt by one who hopes \\n  that his day 's path may end as he began it \\n in that star 's smile , whose light is like the scent \\n of a jonquil when evening breezes fan it , \\n  or the soft note in which his dear lament \\n the brescian shepherd breathes , or the caress \\n that turned his weary slumber to content . \\n  so knew i in that light 's severe excess \\n the presence of that shape which on the stream \\n moved , as i moved along the wilderness , \\n  more dimly than a day appearing dream , \\n the ghost of a forgotten form of sleep \\n a light from heaven whose half extinguished beam \\n  through the sick day in which we wake to weep \\n glimmers , forever sought , forever lost . \\n so did that shape its obscure tenour keep \\n  beside my path , as silent as a ghost \\n but the new vision , and its cold bright car , \\n with savage music , stunning music , crost \\n  the forest , and as if from some dread war \\n triumphantly returning , the loud million \\n fiercely extolled the fortune of her star . \\n  a moving arch of victory the vermilion \\n and green azure plumes of iris had \\n built high over her wind winged pavilion , \\n  and underneath aetherial glory clad \\n the wilderness , and far before her flew \\n the tempest of the splendour which forbade \\n shadow to fall from leaf or stone the crew \\n seemed in that light like atomies that dance \\n within a sunbeam . some upon the new \\n  embroidery of flowers that did enhance \\n the grassy vesture of the desart , played , \\n forgetful of the chariot 's swift advance \\n  others stood gazing till within the shade \\n of the great mountain its light left them dim . \\n others outspeeded it , and others made \\n  circles around it like the clouds that swim \\n round the high moon in a bright sea of air , \\n and more did follow , with exulting hymn , \\n  the chariot the captives fettered there , \\n but all like bubbles on an eddying flood \\n fell into the same

song , \\n me , not the phantom of that early form \\n which moved upon its motion , but among \\n  the thickest billows of the living storm \\n i plunged , and bared my bosom to the clime \\n of that cold light , whose airs too soon deform . \\n  before the chariot had begun to climb \\n the opposing steep of that mysterious dell , \\n behold a wonder worthy of the rhyme \\n  of him whom from the lowest depths of hell \\n through every paradise through all glory \\n love led serene , who returned to tell \\n  in words of hate awe the wondrous story \\n how all things are transfigured , except love \\n for deaf as is a sea which wrath makes hoary \\n  the world can hear not the sweet notes that move \\n the sphere whose light is melody to lovers \\n a wonder worthy of his rhyme the grove \\n  grew dense with shadows to its inmost covers , \\n the earth was grey with phantoms , the air \\n was peopled with dim forms , as when there hovers \\n  a flock of vampire bats before the glare \\n of the tropic sun , bring ere evening \\n strange night upon some indian isle , thus were \\n  phantoms diffused around , some did fling \\n shadows of shadows , yet unlike themselves , \\n behind them , some like eaglets on the wing \\n  were lost in the white blaze , others like elves \\n danced in a thousand unimagined shapes \\n upon the sunny streams grassy shelves \\n  and others sate chattering like restless apes \\n on vulgar paws and voluble like fire .\"], [\"there lies a vale in ida , lovelier \\n than all the valleys of ionian hills . \\n the swimming vapour slopes athwart
